In this repository you will find:

1. [Software](https://github.com/labelinstitute/ageing/tree/main/GARP/Software). The experiment is programmed in Matlab. *LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.*
2. [Instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labelinstitute/ageing/main/GARP/Instructions_GARP.pdf).
3. [Data](https://github.com/labelinstitute/ageing/blob/main/GARP/Data.xlsx)
4. A [read me file](https://github.com/labelinstitute/ageing/main/GARP/ReadMe_GARP.pdf) that explains how to run the experiment and generate the processed data.
